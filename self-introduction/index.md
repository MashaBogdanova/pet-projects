**Auto Presentation**
Hi! My name is Maria Bogdanova. I'm a junior frontend developer.

I graduated from Moscow State University with a degree in psychology. I used to work as a children's neuropsychologist 
for almost 9 years. Few years ago I wanted to try something new and started to learn front-end development.

At first I studied by myself with Youtube channels, courses from Stepik and FreeCodeCamp and tried to solve tasks 
at Codewars.

After a while, I realized - that I really like it! I like visual arts and the visual component always was important 
to me. I adore beautiful layouts and when sites contain animation. I like to implement a behavior with js. 
I was really happy every time I added a script and it worked.

So, I continued learning and for now I attend the Rolling Scope School frontend course.

My first big project I created while studying "React: Way of the Samurai" course on Youtube. It was a social network 
implemented with React and Redux, withTypeScript, hooks (using Redux Toolkit), Axios library, React Hook Form and others. 
Also my application has responsive design, I consulted with my friend UI designer and used AntD and MUI libraries.

While studying in Rolling Scopes School Iâ€™ve done all projects at the first stage. All of them were very interesting 
and improved my knowledge in different areas.

I want to tell about the most joyful project for me. It was the last one - the minesweeper game. That was the first time 
I planned how to organize my code, how to implement it better and I did a lot of refactoring while coding. It was great 
because before I solved tasks somehow and was happy that it simply works. For now code organization is the most difficult 
thing for me - how to create it readable and simple and not to spend a lot of time and tears catching a bug in a big 
and complicated code structure.  And this time I also create a great design and have fun with the process and result.

You can take a look at this and my other projects at my [Github repository](https://github.com/MashaBogdanova).

I plan to finish all three stages in Rolling Scopes School. I will choose React at the third stage, because 
it is familiar to me. A year ago I moved to Warsaw. Now I'm very interested in getting a job here as a front-end developer. 
For now I feel the need for a mentor to make my code more clean and structured, to find weak points to improve, 
to help me with preparing for the interview.

Thank you for your attention. Bye.
